# Chat
The project is started with a intention of getting acquainted with MEAN stack and eventually make it production ready

## Project Plan
#### Phase 1
Phase 1 will maily focus on Back end [Nodjs](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [Socket.io](https://socket.io/) development. A bare minimum webapp will be built to test the backend functionalities. The Idea is to migrate it to Android App using [Native Socket.io and Android](https://socket.io/blog/native-socket-io-and-android/).
Following features will be completed in phase 1:
* Nick name uniqueness check - alert if nickname is already taken
* Group chat
* Private chat(one no one chat)
* User is typing functionality
* User left/diconnected notification to other users
* list of users with online/offline status

#### Phase 2
In phase 2 we would cover advance functionalities like Social login([Google O Auth](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/OAuth2)) and storing messages in [MongoDB](https://github.com/mongodb/mongo). Session management, password encription, error logging are amongst the few things that should be kept in mind.


#### Phase 3 
Phase 3 will mainly be migrating webapp to android using [React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html)


#### Phase 4
Making our android application production ready.An Initial Alpha build would be out for testing and additional features to be added would be thought upon. Stress and Load testing would be done on server and employing necessary mechnism like MessageQueues would be given a thought
